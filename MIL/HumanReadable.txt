The Modified IBM License ("MIL") is a modified form of the IBM Public
License[0][1] (IPL). The MIL shortens the IPL without changing the core message
of the license. It was written with the intent of creating a license with
terms comparible to the GPLv3, but significantly shorter and less terse.

The license allows distribution, sublicensing, modification, and commercial
use of the program.

When sublicensed, the sublicense must:
    0. comply with all existing terms of the MIL
    1. provide a way to obtain the program's source code

The following terms must be met before distribution and use:
    0. provide a way to obtain the program's source code
    1. include a copy of the MIL
    2. agree that liability of damages as a result of use of the software for a
        particular purpose does not fall onto the program's author nor
        contributors. 

The license's disclaimer is as follows:

    Copyright (C) <YEAR> <AUTHOR> and others. All Rights Reserved.

If a given licensee does not conform to the terms of the license, and does not
modify behaviour to comply with the terms of the license in a timely manner,
all grants to the licensee are void. That is, the licensee may no longer
distribute, use, sublicense, or modify the program.

The license extends to documentation provided with the program, where that
documentation is not licensed otherwise.
